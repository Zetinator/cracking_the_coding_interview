# cracking_the_coding_interview
This is a repository with my solutions to the classical, [cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)...

Every file corresponds to a problem from the book, and contains the necessary code and test cases to be executed with the following command:

```bash
python3 <file_name.py>
```
